# Rock-Paper-Scissors
JS Rock Paper Scissors game

v1.0 runs entirely in the console. Games are played over 5 rounds. At the end, the result is declared as either a win, loss or tie,  and the player is asked to start a new match. All rounds are counted regardless of the result, so a 0-0 tie could occur due to 5 straight ties.

v2.0 is going to run in a webpage and be based around user clicks instead of prompting a typed response. Unsure of release date yet.
